Installing SDL_bgi from sources
-------------------------------

Please make sure you have SDL2 development packages. On Debian, Mint,
Ubuntu and similar distributions, please install 'libsdl2-dev' and its
dependencies.

To compile and install the SDL_bgi library (using gcc or clang):

  $ cd src
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

the latter command will copy SDL_bgi.h to /usr/include/SDL2/, 
libSDL_bgi.so to /usr/lib, and will create the symbolic link
/usr/include/graphics.h.

To compile some test programs in the test/ directory:

  $ make test

To remove the library, do:

  $ cd src
  $ sudo make uninstall

Please see the using.txt file in the doc/ directory.

Enjoy!
